## Introduction

This repository contains my City Weather Mapp Web App. The app is designed to demonstrate proficiency in React and Tailwind CSS by implementing two main screens: the Area Selector and Weather City.

The project involves creating interactive components, integrating with external APIs for weather data, and utilizing mapping libraries to display locations effectively.

## Design

This is the original Figma design that served as the foundation for the development of the web application. The design can be accessed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/flyBuKCuyCgOmBufB7zGC8/TestUP?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=tcs06KQtvYheFj9W-1).

## Deployment

The app has been deployed at Netlify and is accessible at: [https://carlos-aliaga-city-weather-mapp.netlify.app/](https://carlos-aliaga-city-weather-mapp.netlify.app/).

## Getting Started

## Tech Stack

The Universal Plastic Test Web App is built upon a robust tech stack that ensures a seamless and modern development experience. Here are the key technologies and tools employed:

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A powerful JavaScript library for crafting dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **[react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)**: A popular routing library for React applications, enabling navigation between different screens.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid and efficient styling, allowing for consistent and responsive designs.

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A fast and efficient build tool that empowers rapid development and near-instantaneous hot module replacement.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing for enhanced code quality and developer productivity.

- **[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)**: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps, utilized through the **[@react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)** package.

- **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)**: A set of low-level UI primitives for building high-quality, accessible components.

- **[clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)**: A tiny utility for constructing class names with conditional logic.

- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: A linter tool for identifying and fixing problems in your code, configured with React-specific rules.

- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)**: An opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project.

- **[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)** and **[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)**: Tools for enforcing code quality and formatting standards before committing code.

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: A distributed version control system to track changes in the project.

These technologies were carefully selected to create a robust and maintainable project architecture while providing an efficient development environment. By combining these tools, the Universal Plastic Test Web App delivers a polished and responsive user experience.
